          I am Sameh Sellami, an accomplished software engineering student with a passion for photography and a keen artistic eye. My unique combination of technical expertise and creative talent gives me a competitive edge in the dynamic worlds of technology and art. I am committed to exploring career opportunities in both fields and making meaningful contributions to their advancement. In addition to my academic pursuits, I am a dedicated member of Enactus, a global organization that empowers communities through entrepreneurship. Our team recently won the Cup of Limitless Challenge for my outstanding performance as one of the pitchers. I am also an avid photographer and am currently pursuing formal studies in the craft with ACPT. I am involved in theatre and am currently creating a project that raises awareness about discrimination and xenophobia faced by migrants in Tunisia, emphasizing the importance of standing up for the rights of others and promoting acceptance and kindness towards all. I am also a member of "Universelle," a humanitarian association that supports orphaned children and homeless individuals in Tunisia.
          Furthermore, as a well-rounded individual, I am an avid reader with a particular interest in philosophical, political, and social books. I am deeply interested in current events and strive to stay informed. This passion for knowledge and understanding informs my work and inspires me to make a positive impact in society. Currently, I am working on "Daily Help," a pioneering company that designs and provides specialized clothing for patients undergoing dialysis and infusion treatments. The company prioritizes comfort, convenience, and dignity to enhance the overall treatment experience for patients. With my exceptional technical skills, artistic talents, and commitment to social welfare, I am poised to make a significant impact in the technology and art industries, as well as in the humanitarian field.

          Participating in the Global Peace Summit New York 2023 would greatly benefit my community by equipping me with valuable knowledge, skills, and insights into best practices and strategies for promoting peace and inclusivity. As a leader and advocate for peace and inclusivity, I can use the knowledge and skills gained from the summit to develop new initiatives and programs that can promote peace and inclusivity in my community. Additionally, attending the summit would provide me with the opportunity to connect with like-minded individuals from around the world, which can help me expand my network and build relationships with individuals who can provide valuable insights and support for my community's initiatives. I can share my experiences and insights gained from the summit with members of my community, including NGOs, community leaders, and other stakeholders who are working towards similar goals. This will help raise awareness of the importance of promoting peace and inclusivity in my community and encourage others to get involved in such initiatives. Ultimately, my participation in the Global Peace Summit New York 2023 can have a significant positive impact on my community by fostering a culture of peace and inclusivity and empowering individuals to take action towards creating a more peaceful and inclusive world.          <p>For comments or questions, feel free to hit me up on <a href="https://facebook.com">Twitter</a> or via email.</p>
